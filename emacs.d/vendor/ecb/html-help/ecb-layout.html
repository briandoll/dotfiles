Advice functions to be more intelligent if used with ECB. You can
choose the following functions to be adviced by ECB so they behave as
if the edit-window(s) of ECB would be the only windows(s) of the
ECB-frame:

<ul>
<li><code>other-window</code>
For this one see also the option <code>ecb-other-window-behavior</code>! 
<li><code>delete-window</code>
<li><code>delete-other-windows</code>
<li><code>delete-windows-on</code>
<li><code>split-window-horizontally</code>
<li><code>split-window-vertically</code>
<li><code>split-window</code>
If this advice is enabled then <code>split-window-vertically</code> and
<code>split-window-horizontally</code> are autom. enabled too! 
<li><code>switch-to-buffer</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>
<li><code>display-buffer</code>
Especially if <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not nil it is
strongly recommended not to disable this advice! 
<li><code>other-window-for-scrolling</code>
If this advice is enabled then the behavior of the following functions
depends on <code>ecb-other-window-behavior</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>scroll-other-window</code>
<li><code>scroll-other-window-down</code>
<li><code>beginning-of-buffer-other-window</code>
<li><code>end-of-buffer-other-window</code>
</ul>
<li><code>balance-windows</code>:
Only the edit-windows are balanced
</ul>

<p>For working most conveniently with ECB it is the best to advice all
these functions, because then all the standard shortcuts of these
functions are also usable with ECB without doing anything else. Also
other packages can interact best with ECB if these functions are all
adviced. If these adviced functions are called in another frame than
the ECB-frame they behave all exactly like the not adviced versions!

<p>But please read also the following:

<p>Normally all packages should work correct with ECB and it´s adviced
functions but if there occur problems with a package cause of some of
these adviced functions ECB offers the following fall-back solution:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Deactivate in <code>ecb-advice-window-functions</code> all the
adviced-functions which make problems with other packages. 
<li>For every of the advice-able functions &lt;adv-func&gt; ECB offers a
interactively function named "ecb-&lt;adv-func&gt;" which does exactly the
same as the adviced version of &lt;adv-func&gt;. Use "ecb-&lt;adv-func&gt;"
instead the original one to get the proper ECB behavior even if the
function is not adviced anymore. 
<li>You can bind in <code>ecb-activate-hook</code> the standard-shortcut of
&lt;adv-func&gt; to "ecb-&lt;adv-func&gt;" and rebind it in
<code>ecb-deactivate-hook</code> to &lt;adv-func&gt;. 
<li>Now you have the best of both worlds: The problematic package works
and you have the ECB-behavior of &lt;adv-func&gt; as if it would be adviced.
</ol>

<p>Here is an example: Suppose you must deactivating the advice for
<code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>. Then you deactivate this
function with this option and you can use
<code>ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window</code> instead. Bind the shortcut
you normally use for <code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code> to
<code>ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window</code> (use <code>ecb-activate-hook</code>
for this) and rebind it to the original function in the
<code>ecb-deactivate-hook</code>.

<p>For a detailed description of the valid values see description of
<code>window-size-fixed</code> which is newly introduced in GNU Emacs 21 and
is only available there. Therefore this option takes only effect with
GNU Emacs 21.

<p>Note1: Manually resizing the ECB-windows via <code>enlarge-window</code>,
<code>shrink-window</code>, <code>mouse-drag-vertical-line</code> and
<code>mouse-drag-mode-line</code> is still possible even if the window-sizes
are fixed for frame-resizing!

<p>Note2: The description of <code>window-size-fixed</code> in the
Elisp-info-manual is more detailed than the description offered by
<kbd>C-h v</kbd>!

<p>Note3: With current Emacs 21.2.X there seems to be no distinction
between <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> and <code>t</code>. Therefore this
option takes no effect (means all ecb-windows have always unfixed
sizes) if <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not <code>nil</code>.

Adviced window functions work always in the edit-window. If we are in
an ECB special buffer (methods, directories, etc), and any of the
adviced windowing functions is called interactively (see

edit-window according to the value of
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>. This is useful if you have any
functions that use such functions and you don't want them to fail with
an error complaining that the current buffer can not be split, or
something similar.

<p>Because this may not be desirable in all situations and for all
adviced functions this can be enabled separately for every advicable
function (see also <code>ecb-advice-window-functions</code>). If the symbol
of an adviced function is contained in the value of this option, then
a edit-window is first selected otherwise either an error is
reported or some other special reaction (depends on
<code>ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error</code>); see the
documentation of the adviced functions for this.

<p>For <code>other-window</code>, <code>other-window-for-scrolling</code> and
<code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code> this makes no sense, therefore
you can not enable this for them.

Specifies the sizes of the ECB windows for each layout. The easiest
way (and also the strongly recommended way) to change this variable is
to change the window sizes by dragging the window borders using the
mouse and then store the window sizes by calling the command
<code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code>. Next time the layout is redrawn the
values stored in this option will be used.

<p>If <code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code> is used then the windows sizes are
stored per default as fractions of current frame-width and -height of
the ecb-frame, so the stored values will "work" for other frame

tree-window (i.e. displays all windows of the current layout) so the

The behavior of ECB concerning getting an "other window". This has
an effect if either <code>other-window</code> or
<code>other-window-for-scrolling</code> is adviced by ECB, see
<code>ecb-advice-window-functions</code>. The following settings are
possible:

<p><code>all</code>:

<p>ECB will cycle through all windows of the ECB-frame or scroll simply
the next window in the ECB-frame, means it behaves like the original
<code>other-window</code> rsp. the original
<code>other-window-for-scrolling</code>.

<p><code>only-edit</code>:

<p>ECB will only cycle through the edit-windows of ECB or only scroll
another edit-window. If the selected window is not an edit-window then
it behaves like with value <code>all</code>.

<p><code>edit-and-compile</code>:

<p>Like <code>only-edit</code> plus the compile window if any. If the selected
window is neither an edit-window nor the compile-window then it
behaves like with value <code>all</code>.

<p><code>smart</code>:

<p>With this setting ECB tries to choose the
<code>other-window</code>-destination or the "other window" to scroll in a
smart and intuitive way: If point is in one of the edit-windows and if
the edit-area is splitted then always the "next" edit-window is
choosen (whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window is the
first edit-window)- if the edit-area is unsplitted then the
compile-window is used if there is one. In the context of an
<code>other-window</code>-call the <var>ARG</var> of <code>other-window</code> will be
taken into account.

<p>If one of the special ecb-windows is selected then always the "next"
ecb-window is choosen (whereas the next ecb-window of the last
ecb-window is the first ecb-window). In the context of an
<code>other-window</code>-call the <var>ARG</var> of <code>other-window</code> will be
taken into account. If there is only one ecb-window then ECB considers
also the edit-windows

<p>If the compile-window is selected then always the last edit-window
which had the point will be used unless <code>other-window</code> has been
called with a prefix-argument unequal 1.

<p>If there is an active minibuffer:

<p>Regardless of the allowed values above ECB handles the situation of an
active minibuffer during a call to <code>other-window</code> or
<code>scroll-other-window</code> like follows:

<p>If the minibuffer-window is selected then ECB always chooses the
window <code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code> points to (when this variable
is set, otherwise the compile-window or the last selected edit-window
is choosen) when the called command is called to choose the 1. next
window (always true for scrolling another window or true when
<code>other-window</code> called without prefix-arg or with prefix-arg equal
1). Otherwise the window ARG steps away is choosen (in case of
<code>other-window</code>).

<p>If there is an active minibuffer but the minibuffer-window is not
selected then <code>other-window</code> and <code>scroll-other-window</code>
behave like the original version.

<p>In addition to the allowed values above the value of this option can
also be a function:

<p>A function:

<p>This function gets seven arguments:
<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>A canonical list of all currently visible windows of the
<code>ecb-frame</code>
<li>A canonical list of all currently visible edit-windows
<li>A canonical list of all currently visible ecb-windows
<li>The window-object of the compile-window if there is any. 
<li>The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame if there is an active
minibuffer. 
<li>The result of the function <code>ecb-where-is-point</code> - see the
documentation of this function for details. 
<li>An integer which indicates how many steps away from the current
selected window the "other-window" is. Is nil when this function is
called in another context then for <code>other-window</code>.
</ol>

<p>The function has to return a window-object which is then used as
"other window" for the command <code>other-window</code> or for scrolling
another window (e.g. with <code>scroll-other-window</code>). Such a function
has to handle properly all situation for itself. 
<code>ecb-get-other-window-smart</code> is an example for such a function.

Hooks run direct before the ECB windows will be shown either by
<code>ecb-toggle-ecb-windows</code> or <code>ecb-show-ecb-windows</code>. This
means that at runtime of this hook the ECB-windows are still hidden.

<p>IMPORTANT: Showing the hidden ECB-windows is internally done by
calling <code>ecb-redraw-layout</code> and therefore also the hooks
<code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code> and
<code>ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook</code> are evaluated. So there is the
following sequence of hooks during the process of showing the hidden
ECB-windows:
<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li><code>ecb-show-ecb-windows-before-hook</code>
<li><code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code>
<li>&lt;redrawing the layout to show the hidden ECB-windows&gt;
<li><code>ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook</code>
<li><code>ecb-show-ecb-windows-after-hook</code>
</ol>
So be aware which code you add to which hook!

Sets if and how the edit window should be splitted after ECB-start. 
But be aware: This option determines only if and how the edit-window
should be splitted at start-time of ECB. There are five different
values allowed for this option:

<ul>
<li><code>nil</code>:
Do not split the edit-area of ECB after activation, i.e. there will be
only one edit-window after starting ECB.

<li><code>horizontal</code>:
Split the edit-area in 2 edit-windows side by side.

<li><code>vertical</code>:
Split the edit-area in 2 edit-windows, one above the other.

<li><code>before-activation</code>:
Split the edit-area as before the ECB-start, i.e. the edit-area will
have after start a window-layout as the whole frame had before the
start of ECB.

<li><code>before-deactivation</code>:
Split the edit-area into a window-layout ECB had in its edit-area
direct before the ECB-deactivation. This value preserves the full
state between activations of ECB, i.e. the visibility of the
ECB-windows, the visibility of a compile-window and also the full
split-state of the edit-area. But this can only be done if important
layout-options have not been changed in the meanwhile. These are the
options <code>ecb-layout-name</code>, <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code>,
<code>ecb-compile-window-width</code>, <code>ecb-windows-width</code> and
<code>ecb-windows-height</code>. 
</ul>

<p>Default value is <code>before-deactivation</code>.

<p>Some remarks to the value <code>before-activation</code>: If this value has
been set then ECB needs three permanent adivces even when ECB is
deactivated: <code>split-window</code>, <code>delete-window</code> and
<code>delete-other-windows</code>. But these advices do not change any
behavior of these functions but only storing in an internal
ECB-variable the facts that a window has been splitted or deleted. In
addition to this these advices are 100% error-save, means the
functionality of the original functions will be performed in every(!) 
case even if within the advice an error occurs (but normally there can
no errors occur in these advices because they are very simple). 
Conclusion: If you want really all ECB-advices being disabled after
deactivating ECB then you have to set this option to other values then
<code>before-activation</code>. But setting this variable to this value is
really completely save.

Toggle sequence for layout toggling with <code>ecb-toggle-layout</code>. 
Every element of this list has to be a valid layout-name i.e. either
one of the predefined layouts or one of the user-defined layouts.

<p>You can add here as many layouts as you want but to use this option
most effective you should not add more than 2 or 3 layouts so every
layout can be accessed very fast by toggling with
<code>ecb-toggle-layout</code>. It is also senseful to add layouts which
have the same principal outline, i.e. all their tree-buffers are on
the same side of the frame and the tree-buffer-"column" (or
-"row") has identical size for the layouts.

<p>Recommended values are for example:

<ul>
<li>("left10" "left15"), toggles between methods and directories/history
<li>("left10" "left13"), toggles between methods and directories
<li>("left10" "left14"), toggles between methods and history
<li>("left10" "left13" "left14"), toggles between methods, history and directories
</ul>

<p>See also option <code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code>.

<p>This option makes only sense if the value is a list with more than 1
element!
