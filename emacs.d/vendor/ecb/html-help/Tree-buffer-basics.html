<h4>General introduction into tree-buffers</h4>

<p>ECB displays most of its informations (e.g. about directory-structures
or file-contents) in so called <dfn>tree-buffers</dfn> which means the
display of such a tree-buffer is structured in a tree consisting of
<dfn>tree-nodes</dfn>. Every line in a tree-buffer displays exactly one
tree-node. Each node can have any arbitrary number of
<dfn>children</dfn>-nodes. If a tree-node has no children then it is called
a <dfn>leaf</dfn>.

<p>Each tree-buffer of ECB is displayed in an own special
ECB-window/buffer which is read-only ie. not editable.

<p>The difference between a natural tree like a fir and an ECB-tree is
that the root(-node) of a tree-buffer is not visible but only its
children. In the example below the nodes parent-node-1 and
parent-node-2 are the children of the invisible root-node.

<p>If a tree-node contains at least one child it is displayed with a
special expand/collapse-symbol (see the example below). This symbol
allows expanding (rsp. collapsing) the tree-node wheras expanding
means to display the children-nodes and collapsing means to hide the
childrens of a tree-node.

<p>Here is an example of a tree-buffer:

<br><pre>[+] parent-node-1  -------.
[-] parent-node-2  -------|
    [-] expanded  --------|
        leaf-node-1  -----|
        leaf-node-2  -----|-----[tree-nodes]
        leaf-node-3  -----|
        leaf-node-4  -----|
    [+] collapsed  -------´
     |
     `-----------------[expand/collapse-symbol]
</pre>

<p>In most cases an action is triggered when clicking with the mouse onto
a tree-node<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> (e.g. clicking onto "leaf-node-1" or
"parent-node-1" in the example above). Which actions depends on the
type of the tree-buffer. For example clicking on a tree-node in the
ECB-sources-buffer (which is the name of a source-file) opens the
relelated file in the edit-area of ECB (see <a href="ECB-Sources-buffer.html#ECB%20Sources-buffer">ECB Sources-buffer</a>)
whereas clicking onto a node in the ECB-methods-buffer (which is the
name of a tag in the current source-file displayed in the edit-area)
"jumps" to the location of this tag in the source-buffer in the
edit-area (see <a href="ECB-Methods-buffer.html#ECB%20Methods-buffer">ECB Methods-buffer</a>).

<p>Almost every interactor of ECB offers a special popup-menu when
clicking with the right mouse-button (of course also possible via
keyboard, see <a href="Using-the-keyboard.html#Using%20the%20keyboard">Using the keyboard</a>) onto a tree-node (e.g. some
senseful actions possible for directory-nodes like grepping this
directory or performing version-control actions for this directory or
something else).

<p>See <a href="ECB-Directories-buffer.html#ECB%20Directories-buffer">ECB Directories-buffer</a>, <a href="ECB-Sources-buffer.html#ECB%20Sources-buffer">ECB Sources-buffer</a>, <a href="ECB-Methods-buffer.html#ECB%20Methods-buffer">ECB Methods-buffer</a> and <a href="Add-on-interactors.html#Add-on%20interactors">Add-on interactors</a> for a detailed
description which actions are triggered and which popup-menus are
offered in all the interactors of ECB.
