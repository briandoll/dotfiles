<h3>Working with the edit-window(s) of the edit-area</h3>

<p>ECB offers you all what you need to work with the edit-area as if the
edit-windows of the edit-area would be the only windows of the
ECB-frame.

<p>ECB offers you to advice the following functions so they work best with ECB:

<ul>
<li><code>other-window</code>
<li><code>delete-window</code>
<li><code>delete-other-windows</code>
<li><code>delete-windows-on</code>
<li><code>split-window-horizontally</code>
<li><code>split-window-vertically</code>
<li><code>split-window</code>
<li><code>display-buffer</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>
<li><code>other-window-for-scrolling</code>
<li><code>balance-windows</code>
</ul>

<p>The behavior of the adviced functions is (slightly simplified):

<ul>
<li>All these adviced functions behaves exactly like their corresponding
original functions but they always act as if the edit-window(s) of ECB
would be the only window(s) of the ECB-frame. So the edit-window(s) of
ECB seems to be a normal Emacs-frame to the user. This means that you
can split and delete edit-windows without any restriction - ECB
ensures that neither the special ECB-windows nor the compile-window
will be damaged.

<li>If there is a persistent compile-window (see <a href="Temp--and-compile-buffers.html#Temp-%20and%20compile-buffers">Temp- and compile-buffers</a>) then all compilation-buffers in the sense of
<code>ecb-compilation-buffer-p</code> will be displayed in the
compile-window.

<li>If called in another frame than the ECB-frame these functions behave
exactly like the not adviced original versions! 
</ul>

<p>ATTENTION: If you want to work within the edit-area with splitting and
unsplitting (i.e. deleting) the edit-window(s) it is highly
recommended to use the adviced-functions of ECB instead of the
original Emacs-functions (see above). Per default ECB advices all of
the functions mentioned above but with the option
<code>ecb-advice-window-functions</code> you can customizes which functions
should be adviced by ECB. Please read carefully the documentation of
this option!

<p>Another interesting option in the context of the edit-window and these
adviced functions is <code>ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window</code>!

<h4>Documentation of the adviced window functions</h4>

<p>This section describes for every adviced window function (s.a.) how it
differs from the original version. Only the differences are mentioned,
so if you want the full documentation of such a function call
<code>describe-function</code> or <kbd>C-h f</kbd>.

This means the current edit-window which contains the point will be

of the current ECB-layout there are two alternatives:

<ul>
<li>If the function is contained in

is selected (depends on the value of the option
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>) and does then it´s job.

<li>Otherwise the behavior depends on the value of the option

"compilation-buffers" in the sense of
<code>ecb-compilation-buffer-p</code> in the compile-window of ECB. If the
compile-window is temporally hidden then it will be displayed first.

<p>If there is no compile-window (<code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is
nil) then it splits the edit-window if unsplitted and displays BUFFER
in another edit-window but only if <code>pop-up-windows</code> is not nil
(otherwise the edit-window will not be splitted).

<p>All buffers which are not "compilation-buffers" in the sense of

<p>If BUFFER is contained in <code>special-display-buffer-names</code> or

behavior depends on the value of the option

Around-advice <code>ecb</code>: The ECB-version of
<code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>. Works exactly like the original
but with some adaptions for ECB so this function works in a
"natural" way:

<p>If called in any special ecb-window of the current ECB-layout then it
goes always to an edit-window (which one depends on the setting in
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>) and then goes on as if called from
this edit-window.

<p>If a compile-window is used (i.e. <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is
not nil) then "compilation-buffers" in the sense of
<code>ecb-compilation-buffer-p</code> are always displayed in the
compile-window. If the compile-window is temporally hidden then it
will be displayed first. If no compile-window is used it behaves like
the original.

<p>If called from within the compile-window then "compilation-buffers"
will be displayed still there and all other buffers are displayed in
one of the edit-windows - if the destination-buffer is already
displayed in one of the edit-windows then this one is used otherwise
it behaves like the original.

<p>If called within an edit-window it behaves like the original function
except for compilation-buffers (if a compile-window is used, see
above).
