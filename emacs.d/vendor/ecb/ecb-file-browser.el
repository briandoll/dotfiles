adds the path of the new file auto. to `ecb-source-path' at least temporally
for the current Emacs session. This option defines two things:
1. Should only the root-part \(which means for Unix-like systems always '/'
   and for windows-like systems the drive) of the new file be added as
   source-path to `ecb-source-path' or the whole directory-part? For
   remote-files \(e.g. tramp, ange-ftp- or efs-files) the root-part is the

  "*Update an integrated speedbar after selecting a directory.
If not nil then an integrated speedbar will be updated after selecting a
directory in the ECB-directories-buffer so the speedbar displays the contents
of that directory.

Of course this option makes only sense if the integrated speedbar is displayed
in addition to the ECB-directories-buffer.

This option can have the following values:
- t: Always update speedbar.
- nil: Never update speedbar.
- auto: Update when senseful \(see scenarios below)
- <function>: A user-defined function. The function is called after a
  directory is selected, gets the selected directory as argument and has to
  return nil if the the integrated speedbar should NOT be updated.

Two example-scenarios where different values for this option can be senseful:

If `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' is not nil or you have a layout
where an ECB-sources-buffer is visible then you probably want to use the
ECB-directories-buffer \(and/or the ECB-sources-buffer) for directory- and
file-browsing. If you have in addition an integrated speedbar running then you
probably want to use speedbar instead of the ECB-methods-buffer for
source-content-browsing. In this case you probably want the speedbar not be
updated because you do not need speedbar reflecting the current-directory
contents but only the contents of the currently selected source-file and the
integrated speedbar updates itself autom. for the latter one!

If `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' is nil and there is also no
ECB-sources-buffer visible in the current layout then you probably want to use
an integrated speedbar for browsing directory-contents \(i.e. the files) and
file-contents \(instead of the ECB-methods-buffer for example). In this case
you probably want the speedbar updated because you need speedbar reflecting
the current-directory contents so you can select files.

The value 'auto \(see above) takes exactly these two scenarios into account."

This can be useful if `ecb-source-path' contains directories with many files
and subdirs, especially if these directories are mounted net-drives \(\"many\"
means here something > 1000, dependent of the speed of the net-connection and
the machine). Or if it contains remote-source-paths which means paths in the
sense of tramp, ange-ftp or efs. For these directories actualizing the
sources- and/or directories- buffer of ECB \(if displayed in current layout!)
can slow down dramatically so a caching increases speed a lot.

The value of this option is a list where the each element is a cons-cell and
looks like:
  \(<dir-regexp> . <filenumber threshold>)
<dir-regexp>: Regular expression a directory must match to be cached.
<filenumber threshold>: Number of directory contents must exceed this number.

A directory will only be cached if and only if the directory-name matches
one regexp of this option and its content-number exceeds the related
threshold AND the directory-name does not match and regexp of
`ecb-cache-directory-contents-not'!

The cache entry for a certain directory will be refreshed and actualized only
by using the POWER-click \(see `ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons') in the
directories-buffer of ECB.

Default-value: ECB caches the contents of all remote directories regardless of
the size and all other directories if more than 50 entries are contained.

Examples:

An entry \(\"/usr/home/john_smith/bigdir*\" . 1000) means the contents of
every subdirectory of the home-directory of John Smith will be cached if the
directory contains more than 1000 entries and its name begins with \"bigdir\".

An entry \(\".*\" . 1000) caches every directory which has more than 1000
entries.

An entry \(\"^/\\\\\(\[^:/]*@\\\\)?\\\\\(\[^@:/]*\\\\):.*\" . 0) caches every
remote \(in the sense of tramp, ange-ftp or efs) directory regardless of the
number of entries.

\"~\" because ECB tries always to match full path-names!"

This option can be useful when normally all directories with a certain amount
of content \(files and subdirs) should be cached but some special directories
not. This can be achieved by:
- setting `ecb-cache-directory-contents' to \(\".*\" . 500): Caches all

host. But if you are sure that a certain remote host is always accessible
\(i.e. means in consequence that you are always online when working with ECB

ECB does this so directories are displayed as empty in the directories-buffer
even without user-interaction \(i.e. in previous ECB-versions the emptyness of
a directory has been first checked when the user has clicked onto a
directory). ECB optimizes this check as best as possible but if a directory
contains a lot of subdirectories which contain in turn a lot of entries, then
expanding such a directory or selecting it would take of course more time as
without this check - at least at the first time \(all following selects of a
directory uses the cached information if its subdirectories are empty or not).
Therefore ECB performs this check stealthy \(see `ecb-stealthy-tasks-delay')
so normally there should no performance-decrease or additional waiting-time
for the user. There is one exception: For remote directories \(in the sense of
tramp, ange-ftp, or efs) this check can descrease performance even if

This is done on directory-base, which means for each directory-regexp the
files to display can be specified. If more than one directory-regexp matches
the current selected directory then always the first one \(and its related
file-exclude/include-regexps) is used! If no directory-regexp matches then all
files are displayed for the currently selected directory.

Important note: It is recommended that the *LAST* element of this list should
contain an always matching directory-regexp \(\".*\")!

So the value of this option is a list of cons-cells where the car is a
directory regexp and the cdr is a 2 element list where the first element is a
list of exclude regexps and the second element is a list of include regexps. A
file is displayed in the sources-buffer of ECB iff: The file does not match
any of the exclude regexps OR the file matches at least one of the include
regexps.

But regardless of the value of this option a file F is never displayed in the
sources-buffer if the directory matches `ecb-sources-exclude-cvsignore'
and the directory contains a file .cvsignore which contains F as an entry!

There are three predefined and useful combinations of an exclude and include
regexp:
- All files
- All, but no backup, object, lib or ini-files \(except .emacs and .gnus). This
  means all files except those starting with \".\", \"#\" or ending with
  \"~\", \".elc\", \".obj\", \".o\", \".lib\", \".dll\", \".a\", \".so\".
  (but including .emacs and .gnus)
- Common source file types (.c, .java etc.)
In addition to these predefined values a custom exclude and include
combination can be defined. Here each list must at least contain one regexp -
this can be a least the empty regexp \"\"!

Tips for the directory- and file-regexps: \"$^\" matches no files/directories,
\".*\" matches all files/directories."

  "*Mapping from VC-state-values of the backends to VC-state-values of ECB.
ECB understands the following state-values:

  'up-to-date        The working file is unmodified with respect to the
                     latest version on the current branch, and not locked.

  'edited            The working file has been locally edited by the user. If
                     locking is used for the file, this state means that
                     the current version is locked by the calling user.

  'needs-patch       The file has not been edited by the user, but there is
                     a more recent version on the current branch stored
                     in the master file.

  'needs-merge       The file has been edited by the user, and there is also
                     a more recent version on the current branch stored in
                     the master file. This state can only occur if locking
                     is not used for the file.

  'unlocked-changes  The current version of the working file is not locked,
                     but the working file has been changed with respect
                     to that version. This state can only occur for files
                     with locking\; it represents an erroneous condition that
                     should be resolved by the user.

  'added             The working file has already been added/registered to the
                     VC-system but not yet commited.

  'ignored           The version-control-system ignores this file \(e.g.
                     because included in a .cvsignore-file in case of CVS).

  'unknown           The state of the file can not be retrieved\; probably the
                     file is not under a version-control-system.

All state-values a check-vc-state-function of `ecb-vc-supported-backends' can
return must have a mapping to one of the ECB-state-values listed above. If for
a certain backend-VC-state no mapping can be found then per default 'edited is
assumed!

The default value of this option maps already the possible returned
state-values of `ecb-vc-state', `vc-state' and `vc-recompute-state' \(both GNU
Emacs) and `vc-cvs-status' \(Xemacs) to the ECB-VC-state-values."

  "*Define how to to identify the VC-backend and how to check the state.
The value of this option is a list containing cons-cells where the car is a
function which is called to identify the VC-backend for a DIRECTORY and the
cdr is a function which is called to check the VC-state of the FILEs contained
in DIRECTORY.

Identify-backend-function: It gets a full directory-name as argument - always
without ending slash \(rsp. backslash for native Windows-XEmacs) - and has to
return a unique symbol for the VC-backend which manages that directory \(e.g.
'CVS for the CVS-system or 'RCS for the RCS-system) or nil if the file is not
managed by a version-control-system.

Check-vc-state-function: It gets a full filename \(ie. incl. the complete
directory-part) and has to return a symbol which indicates the VC-state of
that file. The possible returned values of such a check-vc-state-function have
to be mapped with `ecb-vc-state-mapping' to the allowed ECB-VC-state values.

ECB runs for a certain DIRECTORY all identify-backend-functions in that order
they are listed in this option. For the first which returns a value unequal
nil the associated check-state-function is used to retrieve the VC-state of
all sourcefiles in that DIRECTORY.

There is no need for the identify-backend-function or the
check-vc-state-function to cache any state because ECB automatically caches
internally all necessary informations for directories and files for best
possible performance.

To prepend ECB from checking the VC-state for any file set
`ecb-vc-enable-support' to nil.

Default value for GNU Emacs: Support for CVS, RCS, SCCS and Subversion \(for
the later one the most recent version of the VC-package incl. the vc-svn
library is needed). To identify the VC-backend the functions
`ecb-vc-managed-by-CVS', `ecb-vc-managed-by-RCS' rsp. `ecb-vc-managed-by-SCCS'
rsp. `ecb-vc-managed-by-SVN' are used. For all four backends the function
`ecb-vc-state' of the VC-package is used.

Default value for XEmacs: XEmacs contains only a quite outdated VC-package,
especially there is no backend-independent check-vc-state-function available
\(like `vc-state' for GNU Emacs). Only for CVS a check-vc-state-function is
available: `vc-cvs-status'. Therefore ECB adds per default only support for
CVS and uses `ecb-vc-managed-by-CVS' rsp. `vc-cvs-status'. But read the
documentation of `ecb-vc-dir-managed-by-CVS'!

Example for GNU Emacs: If `vc-recompute-state' \(to get real state-values not
only heuristic ones) should be used to check the state for CVS-managed files
and `vc-state' for all other backends then an element
\(ecb-vc-dir-managed-by-CVS . vc-recompute-state) should be added at the
beginning of this option."

  "Return 'CVS if DIRECTORY is managed by CVS. nil if not.

This function tries to be as smart as possible: First it checks if DIRECTORY
is managed by CVS by checking if there is a subdir CVS. If no then nil is
returned. If yes then for GNU Emacs it takes into account the value of
`vc-cvs-stay-local': If t then just return 'CVS. Otherwise ECB checks the root
repository if it is a remote repository. If not just 'CVS is returned. If a
remote repository it checks if the value of `vc-cvs-stay-local' is a string
and matches the host of that repository. If yes then just 'CVS is returned. If
not then ECB checks if that host is currently accessible by performing a ping.
If accessible 'CVS is returned otherwise nil. This has the advantage that ECB
will not be blocked by trying to get the state from a remote repository while
the host is not accessible \(e.g. because the user works offline).

Special remark for XEmacs: XEmacs has a quite outdated VC-package which has no
option `vc-cvs-stay-local' so the user can not work with remote
CVS-repositories if working offline for example. So if there is no option
`vc-cvs-stay-local' then ECB performs always the repository check mentioned
