;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file upgrades an old ECB-version best possible to the latest one.
;;
;; What is the intention of this library:
;;
;; Big packages like ECB will be enhanced and developed continuously so
;; sometimes a new version must be released. Such packages offer in general a
;; lot of customizable options so probably some of these options change the
;; type or are renamed because the old type and/or name of the option makes no
;; sense in the new release.
;;
;; Especially options which have changed the type of their value are now a
;; problem for the user which want to upgrade to the latest ECB-version: If
;; the user has saved a certain value for option X in its .emacs-file but the
;; type of this saved value doesn't match the new defined type in the
;; defcustom-form after an ECB-upgrade then there can occur serious problems
;; like ECB can not be started anymore or even Emacs can not be started
;; without errors.
;;
;; Until now there was only one way to fix these problems: The user must
;; manually edit his .emacs-file and remove all entries for options which have
;; now another type. After this and after restarting Emacs the new
;; default-values of the type-changed options in the new ECB-release are
;; active and the user can go on using Emacs and ECB. But this approach to fix
;; the incompatible-option-problem has two serious drawbacks:
;; 1. The user must manually edit the customize-section in his .emacs-file.
;;    This should normally not be done and if then only by old-handed
;;    Emacs-users.
;; 2. The customized value of the option X in the old-release (with the old
;;    type) is lost because after removing the related entry from the
;;    .emacs-file the new default-value is active, so the user must
;;    re-customize the option X.
;;
;; OK, this is one half of the option-upgrade-problem but a new ECB-release
;; can also rename a option from name X to name Y because the new name Y makes
;; much more sense and/or is more mnemonic. If only the name has changed but
;; not the type this is not a serious problem like above but also annoying
;; because the customized value of the old-option X takes no effect in the new
;; release but instead the default-value of the new-option Y is now active.
;; But nevertheless this problem has the drawback number 2 (see above).
;;
;; The last category of upgrade-problems is a renamed option which has also
;; changed its type.
;;
;; ecb-upgrade.el is the solution for all these problems:

;; - It checks all customized values of all ECB-options if they are still
;;   type-compatible. If not then it tries to upgrade the old-value to the new
;;   value-type and if this is not possible then it resets the option to the
;;   new default value and store it via customize in the .emacs-file (or in
;;   any file which is used for customized options).
;; - It offers a special constant `ecb-upgradable-option-alist' which allows
;;   the ECB-maintainers to define special transformings for renamed options
;;   so even the value of an old-option X can be savely transformed to the
;;   new-option Y and the old setting is not lost.
;;
;; All these checks and transformings are done at beginning of activating ECB.
;; If ECB has recognized incompatible or renamed options it does its
;; upgrading/reseting-job so all ECB-options have correct types so ECB can
;; start correct. After ECB is started it displays a list of all upgraded or
;; reseted option with their old and new values.
;;
;; How does this library work:
;;
;; The important functions are `ecb-check-not-compatible-options' and
;; `ecb-upgrade-not-compatible-options':
;;
;; The former one checks if all customized values of ECB-options have still
;; correct type. If not the incompatible options and their old values are
;; stored in an alist `ecb-not-compatible-options'. Only this function is
;; allowed to changed this alist!!
;;
;; The latter one processes now this alist and looks for every incompatible
;; option if there is an entry in `ecb-upgradable-option-alist'. If yes then a
;; special value-transforming is tried by `ecb-option-upgrade'. If no or if
;; the special transforming has been failed for any reason then it resets the
;; option to the default-value of current active ECB-version and save it via
;; `customize-save-variable'.
;;
;; So if the ECB-maintainers define no special transforming in the alist
;; `ecb-upgradable-option-alist' for a re-typed option X then all incompatible
;; options are at least reset to their current default-value and therefore ECB
;; can start correct.
;;
;; But there is another function `ecb-upgrade-renamed-options': This function
;; processes the alist `ecb-upgradable-option-alist' and call for every
;; element-key (an old option-symbol) of this alist `ecb-option-upgrade' but
;; only if this element-key is not also contained in the alist
;; `ecb-not-compatible-options' because in this case this option has been
;; already be upgraded/reseted by `ecb-upgrade-not-compatible-options' (see
;; above).
;;
;; So the calling sequence of these three functions must be:
;; 1. `ecb-check-not-compatible-options'
;; 2. `ecb-upgrade-not-compatible-options'
;;    `ecb-upgrade-renamed-options' or vice versa.
;; 
;; There are also two interactive commands:
;; - `ecb-display-upgraded-options' displays a temp. buffer with all upgraded
;;   or reseted ECB-options with their old and new values.
;; - `ecb-upgrade-options': Does all necessary beginning with the
;;   incompatibility-check and ending with the display of the options.
;;
;; What must an ECB-maintainer do:
;;
;; + If he wants only a save and correct ECB-start with the new release:
;;   NOTHING
;; + If he wants to preserve best possible the customized values of now
;;   type-incompatible and/or renamed options:
;;   - Adding entries to the alist `ecb-upgradable-option-alist' and
;;   - Defining suitable transforming-functions for every of these options.
;;   See the comment of `ecb-upgradable-option-alist'.

;; As an addition to this upgrade feature this library offers a set of
;; functions ecb-package-... for downloading and installing newer versions of
;; packages (ecb itself and the required packages)!

  "Alist of all options which should be upgraded for current ECB-version.
There are several reasons why an option should be contained in this alist:
a) An old option has just be renamed in current-ECB version but has still the
   same type of value so the new option should get the value of the old one.
b) An old option has changed its type and we try to transform the old-typed
   value to the new type.
c) An old option has be renamed and also changed its type so we try to
   transform the value of the old option to the type of the new option and set
   the new option to this transformed value.

If an old option has changed its type and we can not savely transform the
old-value to the new type then this option should NOT be contained in this
alist! Such an option is auto. reset to the current default-value by
`ecb-upgrade-not-compatible-options'!

Every element of this alist has the following form:
The car is the old option symbol and the cdr is a 2-element-list with:
1. elem: The new option symbol \(can be equal with the old option symbol, see
   b) above)
2. elem: A function which converts the value of the old option to the new
   option. If the type of the options is identical \(i.e. only the option name
   has been changed, see a) above) then this function should be `identity'
   otherwise a function which gets one argument \(the value of the old option)
   and returns either a corresponding value for the new option with the new
   correct type or the symbol 'ecb-no-upgrade-conversion if no correct
   conversion can be performed! Maybe the function `ecb-option-get-value' can
   be helpful within such a transforming-function.")

It is that file Emacs uses to save customize-settings. This file is

ECB automatically makes a backup-file of that file which will be modified by
storing the upgraded rsp. renamed ECB-options. This backup file gets a unique
name by adding a suffix \".before_ecb_<version>\" to the name of the modified
file. If such a file already exists ECB adds a unique number to the end of the

If you want to upgrade to a newer ECB-version via `ecb-download-ecb' or if you
must upgrade to newer semantic- and/or eieio-versions \(because ECB requires
these newer versions) then this option specifies which version-types are
allowed. ECB checks on the download-sites of ECB/semantic/eieio which versions
are currently available and then downloads always the latest version matching
the specified type:

2: Gets the newest version of all stable versions available.
1: Gets the newest version of all stable and beta versions available.
0: Gets the newest version of all stable, beta and alpha versions
   available.
-1: Ask before downloading in the minibuffer for a version \(TAB-completion
    of all available versions is possible).

So, 2 means stable, 1 means stable and betas, 0 means stable, betas and alphas
and -1 means ask the user for a version.

Per default stable and beta-versions are allowed \(value 1). This comes also
from the fact, that currently speedbar is only available in beta versions
which are very stable.

;; 3: Gets the newest version of all stable versions available.

;; 1: As 2 plus beta versions available.
;; 0: As 1 plus alpha versions available.
;; -1: Ask before downloading in the minibuffer for a version \(TAB-completion
;;     of all available versions is possible).

;; So, 3 means stable, 2 means stable and pre-release, 1 means stable,
;; pre-release and betas, 0 means stable, pre-release, betas and alphas and -1

;; Per default stable, pre-release and beta-versions are allowed \(value 1). This

of `ecb-download-install-parent-dir'. If no failure occurs during this process
the full path of the directory is returned in which the new package is
installed. Otherwise an error is reported.

For correct downloading and installing the utilities \"wget\", \"tar\" and
\"gzip\" are needed which are available for Unix and also for windows with
cygwin. Ensure that the ECB-configuration of these tools is correct for your
system \(see `ecb-wget-setup', `ecb-gzip-setup' and `ecb-tar-setup').

If you are behind a firewall and you have to use a proxy you maybe need the
following wget-configuration in your \"~/.wgetrc\"-file:

   # Define your proxies \(where 8080 and 8081 are examples for the portnumbers)
   http_proxy = http://your.proxy.com:8080
   ftp_proxy  = http://your.ftpproxy.com:8081
     
   # If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
   use_proxy = on

ECB will try to download the file: \"<URL><PACKAGE>-<VERSION>.tar.gz\".
Example: For PACKAGE = \"ecb\", VERSION = \"1.90\" and URL =
\"http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/ecb/\" the download-file would be
\"http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/ecb/ecb-1.90.tar.gz\".

After successful downloading the new package version will be installed in a
new subdirectory of `ecb-download-install-parent-dir'. After adding this new
subdirectory to `load-path' and restarting Emacs the new package version can be
activated."
